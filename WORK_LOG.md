| Sep 11 |   7-8pm   | I wrote psuedocode to solve the problem. I thought about scenarios that I could simplify down to in the code to find the perfect solution which could be applied to n cities. I think that I found the lowest costing solution, having 1 hospital and the rest highways |

Date: Sep 15 Time 7-7:45, 8-8:30 Update: I tried to think about how to effectively solve this problem. I still haven't done much in code so I'm planning on going to tutorial tomorrow, but I think that using a binary tree type of system would be the best. I haven't figured out how to implement that yet or if that is the best course of action, 
so I'll ask that in class. Most of my time was just spent thinking to see if there were any other methods that could be better, but I think using parents and children would be the best, and the cities already remind me of nodes. I still don't know if I should have an array
