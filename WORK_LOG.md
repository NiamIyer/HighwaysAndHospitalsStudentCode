| Sep 11 |   7-8pm   | I wrote pseudocode to solve the problem. I thought about scenarios that I could simplify down to in the code to find the perfect solution which could be applied to n cities. I think that I found the lowest costing solution, having 1 hospital and the rest highways |

Date: Sep 15 Time 7-7:45, 8-8:30 Update: I tried to think about how to effectively solve this problem. I still haven't done much in code so, I'm planning on going to tutorial tomorrow, but I think that using a binary tree type of system would be the best. I haven't figured out how to implement that yet or if that is the best course of action, 
so I'll ask that in class. Most of my time was just spent thinking to see if there were any other methods that could be better, but I think using parents and children would be the best, and the cities already remind me of nodes. I still don't know if I should have an array

Date: Sep 22 Time 9:30 - 10:00 AM, 5:45 - 8:00 PM, 8:30 - 9:30 Update: I basically did all the code today (which is why I worked for so long). I knew somewhat about how I should get started, mostly because of the class slides. I asked Deven how he abstracted his code, because I was confused when overhearing your conversation with him about weight balancing. He told me to separate my find method into a part for finding the root and a part for connecting the components. After this, I focused on my base cases which I could return. I had already figured out that you can return (clusters) * hospitalCost + (n - clusters) * highwayCost, so I implemented how I would calculate these if I already knew the clusters count through the other methods. Next, I finished my find method which included the path compression for which I realized that I had already calculated the root (by finding the parent of each connected node until the parent was negative), so I could loop iteratively until the direct parent of the node was the root. I then started the connect method, in which I already figured out how to connect the two nodes (by setting the root of one as the root of the root of the other). I thought about how I would use the negative signs for weight balancing like you had talked about in class, and remembered that I could add to the negative number when combining the two components. Lastly, I kept on getting a result where 3 tests would pass, and 3 tests would fail. I noticed that these three tests had return value that were negative, which meant that there was an overflow error. I spent around an hour trying to figure out which variables to set as longs, before I realized that my casting for the return statement was wrong, as I was doing the multiplication and then casting to a long, instead of casting to a long and then multiplying.
